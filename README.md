**Game Hub**

Description:
Game Hub is an interactive console-based application that allows users to play three classic games: Number Guessing Game, Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Dice Roller. This project is designed for entertainment and to practice basic programming concepts such as random number generation, conditional statements, loops, and user input handling.

**Features**

1.Number Guessing Game:

The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range.
Players can choose from three difficulty levels, affecting the range of numbers and the number of attempts allowed.

Players can choose rock, paper, or scissors, with clear rules determining the winner.

3.Dice Roller

A fun dice rolling simulator that allows users to roll a die at their command.
Players can repeatedly roll the dice until they choose to stop.
Displays the result of each roll in an engaging manner.
